# Modern-Incinerator-Bin

FIELD OF INVENTION:
        The idea of this invention relates to the smart bin for commercial use.

TECHNICAL BACKGROUND:
        This invention relates to the smart bins used in commercial areas such as houses, roadways, hospitals, multistory parking areas, educational institutions, industrial buildings, shopping malls, and temporary buildings.

SUMMARY:
        The problem mentioned in the back ground can be solved by this type of MODERN INCINERATOR BIN. A technological solution to this process of disposal of mask and gloves. We made a few changes to the regular dustbin. The physical structure of the dustbin looks like a regular dustbin. But it is a miniature of the modern incinerators. It will be charged by the solar power source. If we place the modern incinerator dustbin and keep it in school, college, or public places, the people can easily dispose of masks without spreading the virus.The modern incinerator is capable of providing UVC-LED, that kills the corona virus. 
        Hence it is very useful and the garbage cleaners don't get in contact with the covid-19 virus while collecting the waste things in the dustbin. Most of the modern incinerators burn the masks to kill the coronavirus. But we have planned to radiate the masks that kill the genetic material of the covid 19.


DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:
        In the post lockdown period, everyone is aware of wearing a mask and gloves to not get into contact with the covid 19 viruses. It is a better way to fight against the corona virus. However, the disposal of this mask and gloves in the school, college, institution, the hostel, roadways, industries, etc are not much managed hygienically. 
        The people throw their masks in the normal dustbin without any care. So, to avoid the spread of this virus we have created a better way to dispose of masks. When we throw the masks into the garbage the strap of these masks gets entangled in the birds, which has the effect of spreading coronavirus to the birds easily. From birds the virus spreads to other animals which leads to the fast spread of covid 19. 
        The existing method burn the masks to kill corona virus. This method of disposal creates pollution to the environment. It also damages the public health. The installation of incinerators is expensive. When we dispose of the masks directly to the garbage without sterilizing the masks, the workers will get easily get into contact with the coronavirus when they collect waste without wearing gloves.
        UVC - LED disinfection is a new technology that uses the light to damage the DNA of pathogens.
